 <p>THE PICKLE MAN: The setback
By: Trenton Roach
Once upon a time, there was a guy named Bob who owned a cucumber farm. He lives alone in South Africa in a slightly warm environment. Every 50-60 days he wakes up at 4-5 o’clock to pick his cucumbers if they are done and starts the pickling process. He has enough to last him till the next time his pickles were done. He picks them early and makes sure they do not start to yellow on him. He starts the pickling process by putting the cucumbers in salty water which turns them into pickles. When the pickling process is done, he jars them and sells them.
One morning he had to pick his cucumbers because it was time to pick them. When he got outside all of the cucumbers had been ate except for one single cucumber. Bob has to have 50 jars ready by 2:00, but he only has 20 jars left. The pickling process won’t be done until 1:50, and 10 minutes isn’t enough time to get 30 jars packed.
 When the truck got there, he had 2 more boxes left to pack. When to truck was ready to go, he didn’t have all of the boxes ready to be packed, so he had to go deliver them himself later. When he got there, he didn’t see what he wanted to see. What he wanted to see was the owner happy to see the rest of the boxes, but what he saw was the owner confronting him on why he didn’t have all the pickles he ordered ready by the time his truck got there. The reason Bob didn’t have the pickles ready was because, he had a setback because all of his cucumbers were eaten either the day before or that night.hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhsoooooooooootualvb</p>
